# Matlab Autonomous Lawn Mower (under current development)
Matlab Simulation environment for the self-designed autonomous lawn mower of the University of Lübeck. This environment can be used to test ideas in advance.

## Requirements
* Matlab2017b or higher with different packages

## What does this project do:
* Simulate the lawn mower as realistic as possible
* Test algorithms
* ...

## Testen (zB mit MATLAB R2017b)
* First run the Initialization.m script
* Open test.m and run the code

## TODO:
* Resolve TODO's
* Add IMU Model and Kalman Filter
* Add Unscented Kalman Filter for localization?
