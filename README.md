# Matlab Autonomous Lawn Mower (under current development)
Matlab Simulation environment for the self-designed autonomous lawn mower of the University of Lübeck. This environment can be used to test ideas in advance.

## Requirements
* Matlab2017b or higher with different packages, e.g. Robotic System Toolbox

## What does this project do:
* Simulate the lawn mower as realistic as possible
* Test algorithms
* ...

## Get started
* First run the Initialization.m script which creates a startup.m script
* Run the startup.m script, this will add all folders of the package to your Matlab environment
* Open Run.m, here you can see examples how to use the simulation environment
	* The main class is the ControlUnit, it controls the simulation environment using different methods

## Issues:
* Resolve TODO's
* Add IMU Model and Kalman Filter (?)
* Add different localization algorithm (?)
